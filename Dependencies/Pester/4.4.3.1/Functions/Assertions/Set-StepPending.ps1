    .SYNOPSIS
    Set-StepPending used inside Step Definition blocks will cause those steps to be
    considered as pending.

    .DESCRIPTION
    If Set-StepPending is used inside a step definition block, the test will be
    considered as Pending. It's not a passed result, nor a failed result,
    but something in between. It indicates that the results of the test could not
    be verified. A step definition with a Pending result will be considered as
    Inconclusive when output to the NUnitXml report, unless overridden by
    specifying pending and inconclusive tests as failed.

    .EXAMPLE

    Invoke-Gherkin

    Given "this step is not yet implemented" {

        Set-StepPending
